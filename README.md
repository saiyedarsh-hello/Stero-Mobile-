## 🚀 Latency & Performance Optimizations

To ensure sub-second startup times and eliminate audio playback delay, Stero implements advanced latency optimizations:

* **Manual Range-Request Protocol (`media://`)**: The backend handles byte-range requests manually by serving files via `fs.createReadStream` and responding with `206 Partial Content`. This forces Chromium to stream audio fragments on-demand, allowing local files to play instantly with zero buffering lag.
* **Hover Pre-Resolution**: Moving the cursor over a track card or list row starts resolving the YouTube stream URL in the background. Since the hover gesture precedes the click, the network lookup is completed early, making playback feel immediate.
* **In-Memory Streaming Cache**: Resolved YouTube streaming URLs are cached in-memory for 3 hours. Skipping back or re-triggering a song retrieves the direct media URL in under 5ms.
* **Queue Preloading**: While a song is playing, the queue preloads the next song's direct stream link asynchronously.
* **Asynchronous DB Engine**: JSON database persistence writes are performed asynchronously to prevent disk write tasks from blocking the Electron main thread.

## 💻 Development Setup

Want to contribute or build from source? Follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** (v18 or higher)
- **Git**

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/saiyedarsh-hello/Stero.git
cd Stero
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
Since this project uses native modules like `better-sqlite3`, it will compile the binaries during installation.

```bash
npm install
```
> *Windows Users: If you run into issues installing `better-sqlite3`, ensure you have Python and Visual Studio Build Tools installed, or run `npm install --global windows-build-tools`.*

### 3. Run in Development Mode
Start the application with Hot-Module Replacement (HMR) enabled:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### 4. Build for Production
To package the app into a standalone executable:

```bash
# Build the React and Electron source files
npm run build

# Package the application for Windows
npm run dist
```
*The packaged executables will be available in the `dist-desktop/` directory.*
